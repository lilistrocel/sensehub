## Current Status
- **Total Features:** 189
- **Passing:** 22
- **Completion:** ~11.6%

## Session Log

### Session - 2026-02-07 (Feature #11 - Invalid Login Rejection)
**Assigned Feature:** #11 - User cannot log in with invalid credentials
**Status:** PASSED ✅

**Verification Completed:**
- Navigated to /login page
- Entered valid email (admin@sensehub.local) with incorrect password
- Clicked Sign In button - error message "Invalid email or password" displayed
- Verified user remains on login page (URL unchanged)
- Verified no session created in database or localStorage
- Tested with non-existent email - same secure error message shown
- Zero console errors
- No mock data patterns found in codebase
- Real database queries verified in auth.js (lines 182-192)

**Security Notes:**
- Login error message is generic ("Invalid email or password") for both cases
- This prevents user enumeration attacks (can't tell if email exists)

### Session - 2026-02-07 (Feature #16 - Password Validation)
**Assigned Feature:** #16 - Password minimum length enforced
**Status:** PASSED ✅

**Verification Completed:**

- Entered current password and a short 5-character new password
- Submitted form and verified error message: "New password must be at least 8 characters"
